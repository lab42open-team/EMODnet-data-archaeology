as well as the terminal spine of the exopod, are long, slender, and
serrate or plumose.

Male. A male specimen 3.7 mm. long which I refer to this
species is not in sufficiently good condition to be figured. The —
carapace is less deep than in the female, the pseudorostrum more
horizontal and the spines on the surface of the carapace mostly —
reduced to tubercles. The spines on the dorsal surface of the ab-
dominal somites however are even longer than in the female.

Remarks. This species differs remarkably from all the de-
scribed species of the genus in the spinose armature of the carapace. |
Nevertheless the structure of the mouthparts shows it to be a true —
Campylaspis, though it appears to be exceptional in having the |
ischium of the second maxillipeds distinct and in the imperfect
development of the branchial apparatus.

As I have already noted, these specimens show more disti
than do those from the West of Ireland the double dorsal keel
the posterior thoracic and anterior abdominal somites. 4
