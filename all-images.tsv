Theantero-lateral angle is less acute in the present specimens, but thischaracter also varies with age and sex and is moreover subject togreat apparent alteration with a slight change in the position inwhich the specimen is viewed. The antennules, antenne andlegs are all a little more slender than in the immature male fromwhich these appendages were figured. The antennal flagella arenot complete in any of the specimens but their appearance suggeststhat they do not attain the length of the body. The sides of theabdominal somites are not grooved for their reception. The uropods(fig. 12) have the peduncle shorter and the rami longer than in theIrish specimens. Thus while in immature males of both forms theuropods are longer by about 1/, than the last two somites together,in the Mediterranean specimen the endopod is nearly equal to thepeduncle (24:27) but in the Irish specimen it is not 2/; of that length(16:27). In the adult male the endopod is nearly */, of the lengthof the peduncle. In the shape and proportions of the segments ofthe other appendages no noteworthy differences from the types ofC. helge appear to exist.Occurrence. — Station 17, 18, 39, 44.

J have already suggested (Fisheries Ireland Se. Invest. 1904N: 1 [1905] p. 33) that these two species must be united, the firstbeing described from a young male and the second from an adultmale specimen. A new species occurs in the present collection andis described below.Procampylaspis armata Bonnier (pl. 27 figs. 13—20).P. armata, Bonnier, Ann. Univ.

Seen from the side the dorsaloutline is moderately arched and the short pseudorostrum is sharplyturned upwards and nearly vertically truncated. The antennal notchis small but distinct and the antero-lateral corner is produced intoa small blunt tooth, not broadly rounded as in Bonnier’s figure. —The dorsal surface is not keeled but immediately behind the middle —of its length it bears a strong median tooth. 5 4There is no eye but a narrow ocular lobe with parallel sidesextends nearly to the end of the pseudorostrum. Seen from the side —it is elevated above the dorsal outline towards the tip where it —carries a pair of small tubercles.The carapace is rather thin and transparent, with a faintly,marked vermiculate texture.The first leg-bearing somite is completely exposed. On thedorsal surface its posterior edge is raised into a transverse laminaproduced and curving forwards in the middle line where it formsa bifid tooth overlapping the hind margin of the carapace. Thesecond somite is produced into a similar tooth not so prominent andnot curved forwards. The pleural plates of the thoracic somites aiunarmed, except for a few small granules. The last two somitesare granular on the dorsal surface.The abdominal somites are all, except the last, beset wigranules, especially on the dorsal and ventral surfaces.penultimate somite (fig. 14) is hardly inflated anteriorly.peduncle of the uropods (fig. 14) is about equal in length tolast two somites together and is twice the length of the endopod.The latter bears three rather long spines on its inner edge and ¢strong terminal spine with a small spinule external to its basThe exopod is shorter than the endopod and has a long and slendterminal spine.Adult female.

On each side of the cara-pace, a little way above the lower edge a row of about six teethruns forward from the hind margin for about 1/, of the length ofthe carapace. The ocular lobe (fig. 18) resembles that of the female.The texture of the carapace is coarsely cellular, as figured byBonnier in P. echinata. The first and second leg-bearing somitesare not produced into dorsal teeth as they are in the female butthere is a pair of tubercles on the dorsal surface of each of thesomites from the second to the fifth. The pleural plates of the lastfour somites are expanded and each is armed with a marginal rowof spiniform teeth.The first five abdominal somites are granulated on the dorsalsurface, the granules becoming spiniform laterally where a verydistinct row above and a less distinct one below define on eachsomite a lateral groove apparently for the reception of the antennalflagellum. The last segment of the antennal pedunele (fig. 19) isnearly twice as long as the preceding.The peduncle of the uropods (fig. 20) is longer by nearly 1/,than the last two somites together and has on its inner edge a seriesof plumose set increasing in length towards the distal end. Theendopod is a little less than half the length of the peduncle witheight spines on its inner edge. The terminal spine is slender. Theexopod is shorter than the endopod.Young males agree in general characters with the femaledescribed above. The carapace shows a fine vermiculate texture._ Remarks. — The females and young males described aboveagree with Bonnrer’s figures and description of his P. armata withsufficient closeness to leave little doubt of their identity with hisspecies. That the adult males belong to the same species is almostcertain, and their identification with Bonnter’s P. echinata is highlyprobable, though there are some important differences from BonnieR’saccount. He describes the surface of the carapace as presenting“ni poils ni épine @’aucune sorte” and he figures the upper surfacewithout any trace of an ocular lobe. {In view of the great difficultyof observing such characters in specimens coated as they often arewith mud I think the differences may be neglected at least untilSpecimens agreeing more closely with Bonnier’s account are dis-covered. The case is somewhat complicated however by the aberrantcharacters of the specimens from the West of Ireland which I havehs422 W. T. Calmanreferred to this species (Fisheries Ireland Se. Invest. 1904 N: 1[1905] p. 33). The Irish specimens are smaller in size and thetexture of the carapace in adults and young of both sexes is coarsely*cellular® as in the adult males described above. The mediandorsal spine in all the specimens which have preserved it unbrokenis bifid at the tip while in the few perfect Mediterranean specimensit is simple. I can observe no other differences, but the Irishspecimens are coated with mud and not in a favourable state forexamination. For the present they may be referred to the samespecies.Occurrence. — Stations 18, 25, 26, 39, 44, 57. Depth 200—1100 metres.                                   Procampylaspis Bonnieri nu. sp.

Seen from the side thedorsal outline is moderately arched, with a slight depression nearthe posterior end. The pseudorostrum is a little longer and moreacute than in P. armata. The antero-lateral corner is serrated withthree or four fine teeth. There are no teeth or spines on the sur-face of the carapace. There is no distinct ocular lobe. The cephaliclobe is produced into a small triangular median process in front ofwhich the lateral plates meet for the whole length of the pseudo-rostrum.The first and second leg-bearing somites are produced dorsally _into bifid laminar teeth like those of P. avmata, that of the secondsomite however being curved forwards like the first. The pleuralplates of the thoracie somites are expanded, rounded and unarmed.The abdominal somites are smooth.

The posterior part ofThe Cumacea of the Puritan Expedition. 423dorsal surface of the carapace is occupied by a group of ratherlarge curved spines (about 10) not quite symmetrically arranged oneach side of the middle line. On each side a little way above thelower margin of the carapace a closely set row of spines extendsfrom the antero-lateral corner to the hind margin. There are apair of small spines at the tip of the pseudorostrum above, Thereis no ocular lobe except for a very small pointed median processon the front of the cephalic lobe.The texture of the carapace is coarsely cellular.There is a pair of dorsal spines on each of the last threethoracic somites. The pleural plates of the last four somites areexpanded and armed with marginal teeth. The abdominal somitesare smooth and each of the first four bears near the anterior enda pair of straight spines sloping forwards on the dorsal surface anda pair of small sharp spines on each side. The outline of the fifth(fig. 27) somite is similar to that of the female. The last twosegments of the antennal peduncle (fig. 26) are subequal in length.The peduncle of the uropods (fig. 27) is equal to or a verylittle longer than the last two somites together and has a series ofshort sete on its inner edge. The endopod is 2/3 of the length ofthe peduncle and has six spines on its inner edge. The exopod isabout 4/; of the length of the endopod. Young specimens ofboth sexes agree in general characters with the female.Remarks. — This species is distinguished from the precedingin both sexes by the absence of the ocular lobe, by the slight butcharacteristic and constant difference in the outline of the penultimate‘somite and by the relatively longer rami of the uropods. In thefemale the absence of the dorsal spine of the carapace and in themale the different armature of the carapace and abdomen are wellmarked distinctive features.

Totallength 4.7 mm.The carapace considerably exceeds half the total length andis much elevated posteriorly. As in C. macrophthalma Sars theside of the carapace bears two oblique keels, which, however, arehere elevated into laminar crests. At about 1/, the length of thecarapace from its hinder margin the upper lateral keels are con-nected with each other across the dorsal surface by a straighttransverse keel and from the junction on each side a short keelrunning downwards and backwards joins the lower lateral keel.The transverse keel and the two short connecting keels form threesides of a roughly quadrangular area sloping downwards and back-wards, the posterior side of which is formed by a ridge runningjust above the hinder margin of the carapace and forming, whenviewed from above, two broadly rounded lobes divided by a mediannotch. Anteriorly the upper lateral keels curve inwards towardsthe pseudorostrum without forming any distinct angle as they do inC. macrophthalma. The short vertical ridge which in the speciesnamed connects the two lateral ridges anteriorly is present, thoughless prominent than the others. The posterior quadrangular areamentioned above and the areas between the lateral keels on eachside are distinctly concave. The portion of the dorsal surface infront of the transverse keel is nearly flat and does not rise abovethe upper lateral keel as seen from the side. There is no eye and-the ocular lobe is represented by a short and narrow process infront of which the pseudorostral plates meet for about 1/, of thelength of the carapace. The pseudorostrum is long, ratheracutely pointed as seen from the side, with the dorsal outlineslightly convex. The antennal notch is obsolete and the antero-lateral angle obtuse. All the keels of the carapace are finelyserrated.The first three leg-bearing somites have transverse crestsdorsally; the last two have each a pair of cristiform teeth on thedorsal surface.The abdominal somites (fig. 30) are ornamented with thinlongitudinal ridges or crests which are finely and somewhat irre-gularly serrate. The first four somites have paired dorsal, lateraland yentro-lateral ridges. On the fifth somite the arrangement of  426 W. T.

The last somite has a short median dorsal and a pair oflateral ridges.The appendages differ very little from those of C. macroph-thalma as figured by Sars. The antennules have the second segmentof the peduncle distinctly longer than the third. The first legsfig. 31) do not reach the antero-lateral angle of the carapace, buttheir distal segments are relatively a little longer than in C. ma-crophthalma. The second legs (fig. 32) are distinguished by thegreat length of the terminal segment which is about */; of the wholelength of the limb. The remaining legs (fig. 33) are a little longerand more slender than are those of C. macrophthalma but do notdiffer in the relative proportions of the segments.The uropods (fig. 34) are longer than in C. macrophthalma,the peduncle being more than 24/, times the length of the lastsomite and a little more than twice the length of the sub-equalrami.The integument over the whole of the body and limbs is verythin and semitransparent allowing the outlines of the internal organsto be seen.Male. A single young male shows no marked differences inexternal characters from the females described above.Remarks. — This species resembles C. macrophthalma ut isat once distinguished from that species by the different form of thecarapace, especially by the transverse ridge on the posterior part,and by the ornamentation of the abdominal somites as well as bythe thin and semitransparent integument. 4Occurrence. — Stations 18, 26, 39.

The followingthoracic somites like those of the abdomen bear each a pair ofspines on the dorsal surface. The fifth abdominal somite has amedian dorsal spine about the middle of its length and the sixth,which is distinctly broader than the preceding, has three spines onthe dorsal surface.

From all these species it is separated by the longspines of the carapace. It is unlikely that the absence of the lastpair of legs will prove to be a permanent character of the species(ef. Carman, Fisheries Ireland Se. Invest. 1904 N: 1 [1905] p. 40)and it is possible that the presence of rudimentary exopods on thethird and fourth legs is also a character of immaturity, or, at allevents, is unreliable as a generic distinction (BonnteR, Ann.

T. Calman, D. Se.British Museum (Natural History). With plates 27 and 28.The Cumacea dealt with in this paper were collected by thelate Herr F. A. Krupp during the cruise of his yacht Puritan inthe neighbourhood of Capri in 1902, and were entrusted to me forexamination by the kindness of Dr. Anron Donen.The collections obtained by the Puritan have already formedthe subject of a paper by Dr. Lo Branco (Mitth. Stat. Neapel1903 16. Bd. pp. 109—278 Taf. 7—9), in which a number ofCumacea are recorded. Of the nineteen species which are therenamed, some, I understand, were identified by Prof. G. O. Sarsand some by Dr. Lo Branco himself. Certain of the specimensSent to me were accompanied by labels in the handwriting of Prof.Sars and it need hardly be said that I have found no reason todispute the correctness of the identifications. On the other handthere are on Dr. Lo Branco’s list the following six species of whichTean discover no specimens in the collection sent to me:_ Leucon nasica Kroyer, LD. fulvus G. O. Sars, Campylaspishorrida G. O. Sars, C. undata G. O. Sars, C. costata G. O. Sars,Diastylis spinulosa Heller.It is to be regretted that the authority for the identification ofthese species was not given as some doubt must remain as to theiroceurrence in the Mediterranean’.f Thave recently reported on a large collection of Cumacea from theWest of Ireland (Fisheries Ireland Se. Invest. 1904. N: 1 (1905)) and it isinterest to compare the results with those set forth in the present paper.                    4 1It need hardly be pointed out that Diastylis serrata and Diastyloideserrata of Dr. Lo Branco’s list (l. ¢. p. 256) are one and the same species._ Mittheilungen a. a.

Diastylopsis sp.It will be seen from this table that, of the 25 species recordedfrom depths exceeding 100 metres in the Mediterranean, 15 occurat corresponding depths off the West of Ireland. There is littledoubt that further collecting will add considerably to the numberof species common to both regions. At the same time the amountof collecting which has been done off the Irish coast is sufficientto make it probable that no very common and generally distributedspecies has been overlooked. It is for this reason that I wouldattach special importance to the cases of species occurring in theMediterranean which have not been taken off the Irish coast. Ofthese, Lewcon longirostris, which is one of the most abundant speciesin the present collection, has previously been recorded from off thecoast of Portugal and from the entrance to Dayis Straits. It has_ not been found hitherto, however, at depths less than 500 fathoms(about 900 metres) and as the Helga collections examined by me didnot extend below 400 fathoms it is possible that its special habitathad not been reached. Apart from this and from the new species,which may be found hereafter to have a wider distribution, the onlySpecies occurring in the Puritan but not in the Helga collections areNannastacus longirostris and Campylaspis macrophthalma. Neitherof these has hitherto been found elsewhere than in the Mediterranean.Both were obtained in comparatively shallow water (100—200 metres)and it is quite probable that they have a less extensive range thanhave the species from deeper water.The types of the new species described in this paper have beenpresented by Dr. Anron Dourn to the British Museum (NaturalHistory).28* 414 W.

Norman added somedetails from a female specimen, probably also immature. The —females and young in the present collection resemble closely Sars’ —very characteristic figure and some of the specimens sent to mebore labels in Prof. Sars’ handwriting. There can, therefore, be |no question as to the identification, although Sars’ descriptionthe inner ramus of the antennule as “rudimenter og knudeformig” —is at variance with the characters of the specimens examined by me. —Occurrence. — Stations 17, 18, 26, 30, 39, 44, 57.

The Mediterranean specimens are much smalthan that from Ireland. A female with brood-pouch well developemeasures only 2.7 mm., while the type-specimen, though immatuis 3.85 mm. in length. The structural differences however are §slight that there can hardly be any hesitation in referring themthe same species. The Naples specimens have generally two teetThe Cumacea of the Puritan Expedition. 417of the pseudorostrum, the teeth on the anterior margin, above theantennal notch, are longer than in the type-specimen, and those onthe lower edge of the pseudorostrum are apparently not alwayspresent. The most important difference, however, is in the pro-portions of the antennule. In the younger specimens thisappendage agrees fairly well with the figure and description alreadygiven. In those approaching maturity, however, and in the adultfemale (fig. 9) it is much more slender, with the last segment ofthe peduncle longer by about '/; than the preceding and a littlelonger than the external flagellum. The branchial siphon is in somecases protruded to a greater length than in the type-specimen,sometimes to considerably more than the length of the carapace.At the tip of the endopod of the uropods what was described asa “long slender spine” is in reality a stout, plumose seta and, inaddition to the spine at the base of this seta, the distal segmentof the endopod has three spines on its inner edge.The adult male specimens are unfortunately fragmentary. Noteeth appear on the dorsal edge of the carapace nor on the loweredge of the pseudorostrum. Save for the absence of the antennalnotch, the armature of the antero-lateral margin of the carapaceseems not to differ greatly from that of the female.In referring to L. tenwirostris, Sars, as the only speciesagreeing with the present one in having a large inner ramus onthe antennule, I overlooked Zimmer’s L. septemdentatus (HamburgerMagalhaensische Sammelreise, Cumacea 1902 p. 3) which howeveris distinguished by the widely open antennal notch and othercharacters.

Invest. 1904 N: 1 (1905) p. 28) but presentdifferences which seem to forbid, for the present, their identificationwith that species. The type specimens of C. helge are an adu :female and an immature male, while the present form is representeby adult and immature males. Comparing the immature specimensof the two the following are the chief differences to be observed.The size of the Mediterranean specimens is much less, the largestimmature male measuring 2.7 mm. against 4.7 mm. in the Irishspecimens and the adult male (fig. 10) about 3.6 mm. while the sadult female formerly described measures 5.8 mm.
