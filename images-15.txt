Among numerous small and immature specimens resembling
closely those which I have recorded from the West of Ireland we:
two females with developed brood-pouch (one of them identified
Prof. Sars) and an apparently adult male. The larger of the
females is not quite 4.5 mm. in total length and the male is a lit
smaller. Sars gives the length of Norwegian specimens as 5.5 mi
for females and 6.5 for males.
Oceurrence. — Stations 17, 18, 25, 26, 30, 39, 44. Depth
200—1200 metres.

Campylaspis suleata G. O. Sars.

Occurrence. — Stations [9 and] 25. Depth 130—200 metres.

Campylaspis macrophthalma G. O. Sars.

A young female specimen was identified by Prof. Sars, and
agrees well with his figure and description quoted above.
is, on the anterior part of the carapace, external to the fronto-latei
suture, and just above the transverse ridge connecting the late
keels, a very distinct tubercle hardly indicated by Prof. Sars, a
the posterior ends of the upper keels do not turn forward as th
seem to do in his figure.

The single male specimen which I suppose to belong to ft
species is in bad condition and therefore I do not attempt to figi
it. It resembles rather closely Sars’ figure of the male of C.
data (Crust. Norway Vol. 3 pl. 59) but appears to differ in the gre:
length of the ocular lobe, which reaches nearly to the end of
pseudorostrum.

Occurrence. — Stations 9 and 25. Depth 130—200 me

Distribution. — Messina, 20 fathoms (Sars).
