The Cumacea of the Puritan Expedition.

With plates 27 and 28.

The Cumacea dealt with in this paper were collected by the
late Herr F. A. Krupp during the cruise of his yacht Puritan in
the neighbourhood of Capri in 1902, and were entrusted to me for
examination by the kindness of Dr. Anron Donen.

The collections obtained by the Puritan have already formed

the subject of a paper by Dr. Lo Branco (Mitth. Stat. Neapel
1903 16. Bd. pp. 109—278 Taf. 7—9), in which a number of
Cumacea are recorded. Of the nineteen species which are there
named, some, I understand, were identified by Prof. G. O. Sars
and some by Dr. Lo Branco himself. Certain of the specimens
Sent to me were accompanied by labels in the handwriting of Prof.
Sars and it need hardly be said that I have found no reason to
dispute the correctness of the identifications. On the other hand
there are on Dr. Lo Branco’s list the following six species of which
Tean discover no specimens in the collection sent to me:
_ Leucon nasica Kroyer, LD. fulvus G. O. Sars, Campylaspis
horrida G. O. Sars, C. undata G. O. Sars, C. costata G. O. Sars,
Diastylis spinulosa Heller.
It is to be regretted that the authority for the identification of
these species was not given as some doubt must remain as to their
oceurrence in the Mediterranean’.
f Thave recently reported on a large collection of Cumacea from the
West of Ireland (Fisheries Ireland Se. Invest. 1904. N: 1 (1905)) and it is
interest to compare the results with those set forth in the present paper.

 
 
  
 
 
    
 
   
   
   

4 1It need hardly be pointed out that Diastylis serrata and Diastyloides
errata of Dr. Lo Branco’s list (l. ¢. p. 256) are one and the same species.
