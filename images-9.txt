Nannastacus unguiculatus Spence Bate.
N. unguiculatus, G. O. Sars, Arch. Math. Nat. 4. Bd. 1879 p. 109,
pls. 55—57.

Four female specimens are referred to this species, but as
they are extremely dirty and otherwise in poor condition their exact
agreement in all details with each other or with the published
descriptions cannot be asserted. One of them at least has the
spines on the surface of the carapace more numerous and longer
and all of them have the antero-lateral angle less produced than in
Sars’ figure.

Nannastacus longirostris G. O. Sars.
N. longirostris, G. O. Sars, Arch. Math. Nat. 4. Bd. 1879 p. 119,
pls. 58, 59.

A single male specimen of this peculiar species was obtained.
It agrees well with Sars’ figures in almost all characters visible
without dissection but the antennules are considerably longer and
more slender.

Occurrence. — Station 29. Depth 100 metres.

Distribution. — Spezia, 6—10 fathoms (Sars).

Cumellopsis Puritani n. sp. (pl. 27 figs. 10—12).

Five specimens in the present collection resemble very closely |

the species which I have described under the name C. helge
(Fisheries Ireland Se. Invest. 1904 N: 1 (1905) p. 28) but present
differences which seem to forbid, for the present, their identification
with that species. The type specimens of C. helge are an adu :
female and an immature male, while the present form is represente
by adult and immature males. Comparing the immature specimens
of the two the following are the chief differences to be observed.
The size of the Mediterranean specimens is much less, the largest
immature male measuring 2.7 mm. against 4.7 mm. in the Irish
specimens and the adult male (fig. 10) about 3.6 mm. while the s
adult female formerly described measures 5.8 mm. The longitudina
depression on the side of the carapace is bounded below by —
sharply marked ridge or fold which is conspicuous even in
youngest specimens. In the type-specimens of C. helge this rid
is represented by a low rounded swelling which only at its anter'
